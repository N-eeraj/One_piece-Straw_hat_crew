		'luffy':[
				"Monkey D Luffy",
				"It's weird how we know so much about Luffy's childhood, yet at the same time, we know absolutely nothing. Our knowledge only stretches to him meeting Shanks, Ace, and Sabo; every event prior to that still remains in the dark. In the grand scheme of things, Luffy's past appears to be just about lighter than anyone else's",
				"Luffy is not a thinker. He is a man of action and passion whose innate innocence and can-do attitude managed to attract the very crew working beneath him. This, however, would be a bit of a bait-and-switch, as the head beneath the straw hat doesn't possess much strategic capability or even direction to get the ship moving a single inch.",
				"Thanks to Rayleigh, Luffy learned the basics of all three Haki types. Training them to a decent level, Luffy had become quite strong. Luffy mastered his usage of Gear Second and Gear Third, and to top everything off, he learned Gear Fourth, a new form with several transformations available."
				],
		'zoro':[
				"Roronoa Zoro",
				"His childhood appears to be covered in layers upon layers of mystery. We are in the dark about his origins, parents, and any relatives for that matter. Even as a child, Zoro was strong enough to defeat most adults, but could not defeat Kuina, the daughter of the dojo's master, Koushirou.",
				"Not one to be outdone by his captain, Luffy's firstmate is nearly able to match him in cleverness. Roronoa Zoro doesn't really like playing the thinking man's game. Preferring to take the path of least resistance, Zoro just moves wherever he feels like. This would in turn give him the worst sense of direction out of any of the Straw Hats.",
				"Shichibukai Bartholomew Kuma sent Zoro to Kuraigana Island, where the World's Strongest Swordsman, Dracule Mihawk resided. The two years that Zoro had to his disposal were spent honing his skill under Mihawk's guidance."
				],
		'sanji':[
				"Vinsmoke Sanji",
				"Sanji received inhumane treatment from one’s own family can be much harder than losing a loved one. The feeling of being unwanted can easily break a human being to pieces and Sanji had to bear with it at a very early age.",
				"Getting into more directly intelligent territory, Sanji is often an underappreciated talent when it comes to his cleverness and creativity. He's a master cook that can not only cook a variety of dishes but can replicate the recipes and flavors of items that he's tasted only once.",
				"He managed to awaken his Haki during the two years he spent there and greatly boosted his physical prowess. Furthermore, Sanji also gained the ability to walk in the air at high speeds and swim in the water faster than a Fishman."
				],
		'chopper':[
				"Tony Tony Chopper",
				"Chopper is kicked out of his herd. Chopper was originally a reindeer with the slight oddity of a blue nose, which caused other reindeer, even his parents, to treat him as an outcast. Moreso, Chopper’s arc featured one of the series’ greatest/saddest moments– Dr. Hiriluk’s final speech.",
				"Taught by the legendary medic Dr. Kureha and having honed his knowledge in the Torino Kingdom, Dr. Chopper has become a capable healer that's able to handle a strong variety of illnesses and injuries that constantly seem to flood the Straw Hat pirates.",
				"Chopper worked on Torino Kingdom and learned advanced medicinal knowledge there which helped him become a better doctor than he was before & managed to make his points stronger and also gain a new transformation in Kung Fu Point. Furthermore, he gained control over his Monster Point as well."
				],
		'brook':[
				"Brook",
				"The Straw Hat with the most tragic past! It’s frankly commendable how Brook managed to endure 50 years of sorrow and loneliness.  After a year of searching, the soul of Brook found the Rumbar Pirates' ship and his body, which had decomposed to bones. Resurrected as a skeleton, Brook put his comrades' remains in coffins.",
				"Brook is a creative genius who shows keen mastery over a variety of instruments. A coveted skill among even the most well-rounded musicians, Brook's musical ability is a much deserved skill for the Future King of the Pirates. Even without those musical talents, Brook has shown a surprising resourcefulness.",
				"Most of his time was spent building a reputation for himself as Soul King. That's not to say that Brook didn't get stronger, however. He learned several new applications of his Yomi Yomi no Mi, such as detaching his soul from his body and summoning the cold of the underworld. Brook progressed quite a lot during the two years."

		'robin':[
				"Nico Robin",
				"Robin’s tragic backstory that spanned two full decades. One that started with Robin losing not only her mother, but also her entire country! Even subsequent to the Ohara incident, Robin had to stay on the run for 20 years, experiencing multiple back-stabbings along the way.",
				"Nico Robin was able to educate herself to be certified as an archaeologist on Ohara, an island acclaimed for its archaeologists and historians.",
				"Robin progressed in terms of strength during the time-skip. She managed to improve the usage of her Hana Hana no Mi and could produce a thousand limbs at once instead of a hundred. In theory, Robin got ten times stronger after the time-skip"
				],
		'usopp':[
				"Usopp",
				"Usopp is the son of Yasopp, a pirate who joined 'Red-Haired' Shanks' crew and sailed away, leaving behind his wife and son. Usopp began to lie that pirates were coming. when he started yelling to his mother that pirates were coming in the hopes that it would strengthen her spirits enough to keep her alive.",
				"As the iconic liar of the Straw Hats, Usopp is always hatching up some line or scheme to get past his opponents. When just words fail to land their mark, his resourcefulness has more than outclassed several of his foes, with his slingshots colorful variety and his hilarious, fake hammers being memorable parts of his arsenal.",
				"Usopp was able to gain a lot of physical strength necessary to survive in a place as difficult as the archipelago. He also managed to study the pop green there and use them with his sniping arsenal. After the time-skip, he became powerful enough to take on most threats that he would've struggled to deal with before the time-skip."
				],
		'nami':[
				"Nami",
				"Nami had to watch her adoptive mother get killed in front of her. And to make matters worse, she was forced to work for her mother’s murderers for more or less an entire decade.",
				"Nami has guided the crew past all manner of complex routes along the seas and has shown an advanced mastery over meteorology. Such knowledge has manifested to a powerful degree with her use of Clima-Tact, a tactful, weather manipulating tool that requires imagination and tight precision on the user's part.",
				"Nami greatly enhanced her knowledge of weather and what's more, she was able to fit her Clima Tact with some great bits of technology, thanks to Usopp's help. Just like the other members of the crew, Nami was several times stronger after the time-skip."
				],
		'franky':[
				"Cyborg Franky",
				"Franky got disowned and was left to die by his pirate parents. From that point on, Franky’s life witnessed many ups and downs. He met a wonderful new family, and came this close to losing said family. His father figure, as well as mentor, fell victim to the World Government’s dirty schemes.",
				"He's built a variety of strong ships since his younger days and somehow implemented that knowledge into rebuilding his own body after a horrific accident. Having used his vast knowledge to create lasers, giant robots, and the Thousand Sunny's puzzle like architecutre",
				"Franky has become incredibly powerful after the time-skip and has gained access to abilities such as the Radical Beam, which is powerful enough to take down even an Ancient Giant in a single hit. It goes without saying that Franky is among the strongest in the crew right now."
